    <p>&emsp;The tarte Tatin, named after the Tatin sisters who invented it and served it in their hotel as its signature dish, is a pastry in which the fruit is caramelized in butter and sugar before the tart is baked. It originated in France but has spread to other countries over the years.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the outside of a 9 inch springform pan with foil to catch drips.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread butter evenly into a 9 inch springform pan. Sprinkle with sugar. Arrange apple slices into an overlapping pattern over sugar layer. Cover apples with pastry, trimming sides if necessary. Place pan on a baking sheet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, until pastry is golden brown. Allow to cool slightly, then release sides of pan. Place a large plate over pastry, then invert so apple layer is on top. Remove bottom of pan and serve.</li>
    </ol>
